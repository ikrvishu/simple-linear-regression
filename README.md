Simple linear regression is a statistical modeling technique used to predict the value of a dependent variable (y) based on the value of a single independent variable (x). It assumes a linear relationship between the two variables, meaning that changes in the independent variable will produce proportional changes in the dependent variable.

The equation for simple linear regression is:

y = β₀ + β₁x + ε

where:

y is the dependent variable
x is the independent variable
β₀ is the intercept, which represents the value of y when x is equal to zero
β₁ is the slope, which represents the change in y for a one-unit change in x
ε is the error term, which represents the difference between the actual value of y and the predicted value of y
